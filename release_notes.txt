			 Details:
			 
			 - New keyword 'cs_create_topology_reservation' added to create reservation and add topology to the reservation created in one step,
			 this is to be compatible with cloudshell v8.0 support.
			 
			 - Existing keywords modified to be compatible with both v7.x, v8.0 of chloudshell api's.
			 cs_create_reservation: going forward this keyword will only save the reservation details to the data repository

			 cs_create_reservation) and add topology to the reservation thus created.

3. Procedure to get a specific version of Warrior 
=================================================

1. Clone warrior main
$ git clone https://github.com/warriorframework/warriorframework.git
2. go to warrior_main directory
$cd warrior_main
3. To check the list of versions available, execute "git tag --list" command
$ git tag --list
3.0
3.1
3.2
3.3
3.4
$
3. To Check the current version you are at, execute "git branch" command
$ git branch
* master
$

- * indicates the active version.
- In the above example master is the active version.
- If the active version is master it means you are using a version of warrior framework that is under development. It is 
not a stable tested version.

4. To switch to a specific version from master, execute 'git checkout <version_name>' command.
$ git checkout 3.4
Note: checking out '3.4'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

HEAD is now at 146313d... reduce command timeout, wait after timeout=60
$

5. Execute git branch command to verify the active version.
$ git branch
* (HEAD detached at 3.4)
master
$ 

- * indicates the active version.
6. Switch from one version to another (current=3.4, switch to 3.3)
$ git checkout 3.3
Previous HEAD position was 146313d... reduce command timeout, wait after timeout=60
HEAD is now at ecb6373... WAR-180, handle nd prompt on timeout
$ 
$ git branch
* (HEAD detached at 3.3)
master
$
7. Switch to master branch again.
$ git checkout master
Previous HEAD position was ecb6373... WAR-180, handle nd prompt on timeout
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
$ 
$ 
$ git branch
* master
